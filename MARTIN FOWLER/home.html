    <p>I live in Melrose, a pleasant suburb of Boston, Massachusetts with my wife Cindy, a structural engineer. We enjoy hiking, both in New England and as a central part of our vacations. I indulge in photography, which I like to inflict on my readers. Since secondary school I have enjoyed strategic boardgames, and have recently become a frequent player on screen with Heavy Cardboard. We often head into Boston to explore the small but vibrant theater scene. I enjoy living in the US even though I miss the particular beauties of the English countryside.</p>
