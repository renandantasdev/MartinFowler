    <h2>Thoughtworks</h2>
    <p>I became an independent consultant in 1991 and since then have seen a lot of companies as a consultant. While I enjoyed a lot of this work, I'd never imagined joining any of them. This was partly because of the fact that I wanted the independence to do the writing that's become an important part of my life, but also because I hadn't come across an organization that was the sort of company I'd like to work for.</p>

    <p>I started working with Thoughtworks in the spring of 1999 and found a company whose attitude to people and customers fitted remarkably with my own views. They build the kind of mission critical business systems that I like to be involved in with the quality that I always aim for. But the key reason I joined them is because they really do believe that people are their biggest asset. I've seen many companies say that as a clich√©, but not here. And that is essential because I've learned that the biggest impact on successful software development is motivated, talented people. If you don't have that talent, all the technology and methodology in the world can't help you.</p>

    <p>I enjoy the irony of my title, as I'm not chief of anybody and don't do any science. I've mostly avoided any business leadership responsibilities, but have served on the primary global leadership team since 2017. I see my main role as helping my colleagues to capture and promulgate what we've learned about software development to help our profession improve. We've always believed that this openness helps us find clients, recruit the best people, and help our clients succeed.</p>
