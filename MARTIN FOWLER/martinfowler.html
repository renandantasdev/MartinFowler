        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <img src="imagens/martin_fowler.jpg">
        I am Martin Fowler: an author, speaker… essentially a loud-mouthed pundit on the topic of software development,
        primarily for Enterprise Applications. I work for Thoughtworks, a software delivery company, where I have the
        exceedingly inappropriate title of "Chief Scientist". I have written half-a-dozen books on software development,
        including Refactoring, and Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. I write for and edit the website
        martinfowler.com.
        My main interest is to understand how to design software systems, to maximize how much value development teams
        can deliver. In doing this I've looked to understand the patterns of good software architecture, and also the
        processes that support software design. I've become a big fan of agile approaches and the resulting focus on
        evolutionary software architecture. I don't come up with original ideas, but do a pretty good job of recognizing
        and packaging the ideas of others, or as Brian Foote describes me: "an intellectual jackal with good taste in
        carrion".
        <h2>Writing</h2>
        For the last decade or more, most of my writing has been published on martinfowler.com. I like the control I
        have to publish what I like, to control its format, and to evolve it as needed.
        I have written several books, all of which published by Addison-Wesley, an imprint of Pearson. I am a series
        editor of my signature series with Addison-Wesley, which has given me chance to lend my support to several
        excellent books.
        I spent five years in the early noughties as the editor of the design column for IEEE Software magazine. In the
        late 90s I wrote a column for Distributed Computing magazine. I rarely write for magazines now, preferring to
        concentrate my non-book writing on my website, which presumably you’ve found by now.
