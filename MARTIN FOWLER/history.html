        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Walsall, England, going to Queen Mary's Grammar School. I went to University College London from
            1983-6 where I got a BSc (ENG) in Electronic Engineering and Computer Science. After graduating I stayed in
            London working for a while at Coopers & Lybrand, and a small tech company called Ptech, before becoming an
            independent consultant in 1991. I moved to Massachusetts in 1994 continuing as an independent consultant
            until I joined Thoughtworks in 2000. I became an American citizen in 2005 (I retain my UK citizenship as
            well).</p>
