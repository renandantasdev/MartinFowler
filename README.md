<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Webysther_20150414193208_-_Martin_Fowler.jpg/200px-Webysther_20150414193208_-_Martin_Fowler.jpg"> &nbsp;
<p>I am Martin Fowler: an author, speaker… essentially a loud-mouthed pundit on the
topic of software
development, primarily for Enterprise Applications. I work for Thoughtworks, a software delivery company,
where I have the exceedingly inappropriate title of "Chief Scientist". I have written half-a-dozen books on
software development, including Refactoring, and Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. I write
for and edit the website martinfowler.com.</p>
<p>My main interest is to understand how to design software systems, to maximize how
much value development
teams can deliver. In doing this I've looked to understand the patterns of good software architecture, and
also the processes that support software design. I've become a big fan of agile approaches and the resulting
focus on evolutionary software architecture. I don't come up with original ideas, but do a pretty good job
of recognizing and packaging the ideas of others, or as Brian Foote describes me: <b>"an intellectual jackal
with good taste in carrion".</b></p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>For the last decade or more, most of my writing has been published on
martinfowler.com. I like the control I
have to publish what I like, to control its format, and to evolve it as needed. </p>
<p>I have written several books, all of which published by Addison-Wesley, an
imprint of Pearson. I am a series
editor of my signature series with Addison-Wesley, which has given me chance to lend my support to several
excellent books.</p>
<p>I spent five years in the early noughties as the editor of the design column for
IEEE Software magazine. In
the late 90s I wrote a column for Distributed Computing magazine. I rarely write for magazines now,
preferring to concentrate my non-book writing on my website, which presumably you’ve found by now.</p>
<h2>Speaking</h2>
<p>I was a regular speaker at many international conferences on software
development. I’ve served on program
committees for OOPSLA, Software Development, UML World, XP 2001, and TOOLS. I gave closing keynotes at
XP2000-2003, served as conference chair for XP2005 and for Agile Universe in 2001. I retired from speaking
in 2021 as it was never something I really enjoyed. Many of my conference talks are available on video.</p>
